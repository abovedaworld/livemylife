Once a child full of dreams
I thought I would never fail
Time has passed and I've learned well
Life won't go on as you wish

*Dreamed of another day
Dreamed of another life
Maybe Lord will take me far away
Dreams of another day
Maybe it's in vain
Somehow I know that I've got to go

#Live my life
You'll never know what's right from wrong
Live my Life
Even though it's all in vain

Now I play under dark blue sky
Take me to another place
I'm bounded by the cowards law
Can I breathe open air?
